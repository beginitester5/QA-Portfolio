# QA-Portfolio
# Welcome to my QA Portfolio! 
My name is Maia Napier, and I am currently in the midst of a career change. I got my bachelors in Criminal Justice and minor in Psychology in hopes of becoming an attorney. As I've lived life a little bit more I have realized that this is no longer my dream. So, in search of something new I started a bootcamp for manual software qa engineering at the end of February and finished it in June. I am currently in the externship of the program to help with my skills. This portfolio showcases my skills and the tools I use. 
## Key Skills & Tools
- **Manual Testing**: Test case creation, execution, and several testing methods.
- **Defect Reporting**: Detailed bug tracking and communication.
- **Tools**: Jira, TestRail, Chome Dev Tools, I am currently enrolled in a course for API's where I am learning Postman, and I am also in a course for Python. 
## Portfolio Overview
This repository includes: 
- **Projects**: TalentNow, a web application used for job search management. Employers post job offers, and candidates can apply to them. The testing scope implies two sides: the employer's side and the candidate's side. Our app supports different browsers, such as Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari.
- **Test Cases**: Examples of of test cases I have created as well as excecuted, mainly functionality and UI.
- **Bug Reports**: Examples of bugs I have reported. Not all of them come from TalentNow, some I have done for softwares or web applications that I've found working at my current position as a legal assistant.
